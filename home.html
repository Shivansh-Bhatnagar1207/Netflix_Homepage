            Misery seems everlasting in Miyo Saimori's life. Born into an
            arranged marriage, she was quickly discarded after her mother's
            tragic death. Her father remarried, and her younger half-sister Kaya
            received all the affection, while Miyo was degraded to a lowly
            servant. Lacking the strength to fight against her family's abuse,
            Miyo loses hope that her luck will ever turn. Unexpectedly, Miyo's
            father summons her to deliver surprising news: she is to marry
            Kiyoka Kudou, the head of the distinguished Kudou family. Despite
            his noble background, Kiyoka is known to be a callous man who has
            thus far dismissed all of his former fiancÃ©es. Upon arriving at the
            Kudou household, Miyo expects coarse treatment and to be tossed
            aside. However, contrary to her assumptions, Kiyoka shows her the
            kindness and love that she has desperately needed. Marrying Kiyoka
            may be Miyo's one chance to break free from her neglectful family
            and embrace a life of happiness
